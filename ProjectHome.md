# ddcf #
A powerful command-line DNS client built on Python. Compatible with Windows, Linux, Mac & BSD, so long as they're running Python2.

_ddcf is an extremely simple project, but I promise, it gets the job done._

I am in no way an employee of CloudFlare, Inc. The largest tie I have with them is an app I made for Earth Hour. [You can see that here.](https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/earthhour) I also sometimes scavenge their Support CRM and Wiki.
